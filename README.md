FastPong
--------

**Running**

Easiest way to get this running is download [LOVE2D 0.9.2](https://love2d.org/)

clone the repo into a directory...

```
git clone https://github.com/tedajax/fast-pong.git
```

Then zip the fast-pong directory and change the .zip extension to a .love extension.

If LOVE2D is installed you should be able to double click the .love file.

**Configuration**

Some limited key configuration is available in conf.lua, should be pretty self-explanatory.

Just edit conf.lua and zip the directory back up, rename to .love, etc...
